License Auditor helps you track and validate licenses inside your project. Prevents unwanted law complications. The license Auditor includes a step in your pipeline and creates notifications about potential problems with used licenses. At the moment, a notification means a comment.

# Getting started

To start using the **License Auditor**, install its package with NPM:

```command
npm install @brainhubeu/license-auditor
```

or Yarn:

```command
yarn add @brainhubeu/license-auditor
```

In the next step, copy `license-template` directory with `licenses.js`, `blacklist.js`, and `whitelist.js` files, naming it `license` in your project. The first one contains a full list of all currently acknowledged, depreciated, and exceptional software licenses. To whitelist or blacklist the license, you must copy selected licenses from the main file into them.

Whitelisting stops **License Auditor** from analyzing and displaying any notifications for a given package with whitelisted license type. Blacklisting a license leads to the generation of fail notification log or causes CI job to fail if the blacklisted license is found, which prevents the developer from merging unwanted dependencies into the destination branch. Any license that is included in neither `blacklist.js` nor `whitelist.js`, but is found during packages analyze or merge request, becomes a warning, which developer should address during merge process or further development.

If a given dependency has no license specified, it's marked with `UNKNOWN` and thus the default blacklist contains `UNKNOWN` license to notify about a potentially unwanted license.

For **License Auditor** to work, all project dependencies have to be installed before an audit. **License Auditor** iterates through the `node_modules` and retrieves the license information from them. List of licenses is also available at [spdx site](https://spdx.org/licenses/).

The order of files in which the license information is retrieved from is: `package.json`, `LICENSE`, `LICENCE`, `COPYING`, `README`. Warning and Error notifications specify the license file that it has been read from. In some cases, license files may not provide the license directly. The asterisk `*` symbol next to shown license name indicates that it is the closest possible, but not fully confirmed license.

# Usage and examples

## Continuous Integration tools adaptation

If you intend to use **License Auditor** with GitLab CI or GitHub Actions, you have to copy [CI example file](./examples/ci_example.js) to the root of your project directory and RENAME it to `dangerfile.js`. This example provides a base for CI-oriented licenses checking using DangerJS (for more information this framework, visit [official Danger Systems site](https://danger.systems/js/)).

Then, you have to include it in your pipeline. The basic structure of **Gitlab** pipeline step should look like this:

```yaml
check_foo_licenses:
  stage: CheckFooLicenses
  image: node:alpine
  script:
    - yarn add -D danger @brainhubeu/license-auditor
    - yarn danger ci --failOnErrors --id Foo
  variables:
    DANGER_GITLAB_API_TOKEN: $GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN
    PROJECT_PATH: $PATH_TO_FOO_PACKAGE # it could look like: ./packages/web or ./server
  only:
    - merge_requests
```

and the basic structure for **Github Actions**:

```yaml
  - name: CheckBarLicenses
        run: |
          yarn add -D danger @brainhubeu/license-auditor
          yarn danger ci --failOnErrors --verbose --id Bar
        env:
          DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          PROJECT_PATH: $PATH_TO_BAR_PACKAGE # it could look like: ./packages/web or ./server
```

You can find more examples in examples directory for [GitLab](./examples/gitlab) and [GitHub](./examples/github).

To allow automatic comments posting on MRs/PRs, you need to create either `Gitlab Access Token` or `Github Access Token` in a profile that is going to post comments
under MRs/ PRs. Then you need to specify environmental variables with key `DANGER_GITLAB_API_TOKEN` or `DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` and value being the acquired token.
The Access Token needs to have the ability to use the Github/Gitlab API and write discussions for MRs/PRs.

#### Gitlab:

![Gitlab Access Token](./assets/gitlab_access_token_screenshot.png)

#### Github:

![Github Access Token](./assets/github_access_token_screenshot.png)

In provided examples, the new Gitlab and Github accounts were created to act as a "bot", that was posting MR/PR comments based on license information. Both of them were named [HAL9002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000).

The comments should look similar to:

for Gitlab:

![Gitlab Comment Warn](./assets/gitlab_comments.png)

for Github:

![Gitlab Comment Error](./assets/github_comments.png)

You can find more information about Github and Gitlab configuration [here](https://danger.systems/js/guides/getting_started.html).

## Logging tool and own implementation

To use a logging tool instead of CI, copy [logging example file](./examples/logging_example.js) to the root of your project directory. It is intended to log used license information into the console of your preference. To use it, you need to have a JavaScript runtime environment installed (e.g. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)). Then, just simply type:

```command
node logging_example.js
```

This command will list fails for every dependency that was blacklisted in `blacklist.js` file and warnings for licenses that are missing on both `whitelist.js` and `blacklist.js` files.

You can also create your own implementation of `warn` and `fail` methods behavior based on your needs. To do so, we recommend to copy [logging example file](./examples/logging_example.js) and change `fail` and `warn` methods implementations, remembering to preserve `msg` input parameter and not to add new parameters, as they will be of no use.

# Contributing

# Releasing a new version of the package

1. Create a new branch `release-<version>` e.g. `release-v1.1.1`.
2. Run `yarn version` command and set a new version e.g `v1.1.1`. Follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).
3. Push your branch along with created tag e.g. `git push --set-upstream origin release-v1.1.1 --tags`.
4. Open pull request.
5. Once pull request is merged, create a new release on Github. Select existing tag e.g. `v1.1.1` and fill in release notes. A new version will be published using Github Actions :tada:.
## Tests
- run `yarn test`
